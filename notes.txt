We have WareHousing: So we will create a mini-data base using Excel to be able to evalauate all the Inputs and tuples in Inputs
Table: Warehouses
- id
- location
- capacity
- supervisor_address

Table: StoredMedicines
- id
- warehouse_id
- medicine_id
- entry_timestamp
- exit_timestamp
- current_status (e.g., stored, released, rejected)
